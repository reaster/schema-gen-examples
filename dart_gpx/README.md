# dart_gpx

[GPX](https://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) Dart/Flutter support library for reading and writing JSON formatted GPX data.

## Description

This code was generated using [schema-gen](https://github.com/reaster/schema-gen).

XML Schema input: 

- [gpx.xsd](https://github.com/reaster/schema-gen-examples/blob/master/java-gpx/src/main/resources/gpx.xsd)

Generated artifacts:

- gpx.dart - properties, equals, hashCode, [json_annotation](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/json_annotation), toJson and fromJson method stubs.
- gpx.g.dart - toJson and fromJson method implmentations.

### Notes

- DartJsonEmitter is a temporary replacement for [json_serializable](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/json_serializable) which lacked good toJson support at the time of publication.

- Despite the model being generated form a XML Schema, XML marshalling is not supported. Instead it's assumed this Dart client will be talking JSON to a server (possibly running schema-gen generated Java or Kotlin code) that can transmit both XML and JSON.

- This code was generated by running DartGenMain with initGpx() configuration call.
